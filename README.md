# R5D5-Project

The NBA Player Salary Prediction System is a machine learning project designed by group of second-year computer science undergraduates studying at IIT Sri Lanka. The goal of the project is to develop a web application that predicts the salary of NBA players based on various factors, such as performance statistics, experience and team. The web application will be created using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, while the machine learning model will be implemented using Python.

The web application will have a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to see player statistics and view predictions for their salaries. The interface will also allow users to compare the predicted salaries and status of different players.
The web application will be hosted on a server and will be accessible from any device with an internet connection. This will allow users to access the salary predictions from anywhere and at any time. In addition, the web application will be designed to be scalable and efficient, so that it can handle a large number of requests and provide fast and accurate predictions.

we will also implementing a database to store the data used by the machine learning model. The database will be created using MongoDB and will allow the team to easily update the data used by the model as new information becomes available. This will ensure that the model remains accurate and up-to-date, even as the NBA changes and evolves.

In conclusion,This project will provide valuable insights into the salaries of NBA players and help users understand how different factors impact salary predictions.In general use this application will help to simplify the negotiation process between player agents and club managers to increase the economical gain for both the parties.
